    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-  A database is an organised collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of databases:\n",
    "1. SQL(relational databases)\n",
    "2. NoSQL(non - relational databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational model where data is stored in rows and tables that are linked in various ways.On the other hand, NoSQL databases allow different structures than a SQL database and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases have a well-designed schemas, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning we can increase the load on a server by migrating to a larger server that adds more CPU , RAM OR SSD capability. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable as they use mulitple nodes in a cluster to handle increased workloads.\n",
